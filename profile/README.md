<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### Welcome to the Seamless Smart Home Project!

The name Seamless Smart Home comes from a principle that has stuck with me since I read a blog post many years ago that explained the principles behind Home Assistant. In short, any automation inside the home must be "wife-approved," meaning it should be seamless for anyone to use without having to think about the automation, know specific voice commands, download an app, or interact with a dashboard. Inside this collection of repositories, you will find several community projects focused on filling gaps in current home automation, the main focus of these projects is making your automation system more contexually aware of who is in the home AND where they are located within the home, while simultaneously increasing the privacy of those within the home.

| [HestiaNVR](https://github.com/Seamless-Smart-Home/HESTIA-NVR) | HestiaNVR's goal is to become the conrnerstone of a contexually aware smart home, by giving your automation system a set of eyes to litterally see the state of each room. However, our homes are our most private and intimate places, using cameras or other sensors in most parts of the home requires a level of security and privacy aware features not offered by current solutions today. |
| [GoComm](https://github.com/Seamless-Smart-Home/GoComm)        | GoComm uses contexually aware inputs from your home automation system to intteligantly route intercomm communications throughout your home and beyond.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
